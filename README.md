# Ungravity

This game was made during the [Ludum Dare October 2021](https://ldj.am/$261566) event and was made in a time span of less than 72h.

Every texture, every sound and every game object or script was made during the game jam.
The only two exceptions are raw character animations which where loaded from [mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/) (controller etc. were written during the jam) and minor sound effects (steps, horn, ground hit).

## Background
You awake in your space station after the experiment yesterday.
You soon notice it has multiple breaches and it is only a question of time until you die if you can't reach your shuttle.

Very soon you'll realize the terrible implications of your experiment yesterday...
## Gameplay

### Movement
- A / D : Walking sideways
- Space : Jump
- Shift : Sprint
- M     : toggle UI overlays on/off

### Mechanics
- Your goal is to reach the space ship - at any cost!
- Debris from your space station will allow you to move - or block you
- Instant movement on contact between paired portals
- You will need to pick up oxygen canisters to avoid suffocation
>! The gravity will randomly turn
>! Gravity mines will trigger a chaotic series of gravity realignments

## Finally
It was a really fun jam. Hopefully all of you had as much fun as we did and you can now fully enjoy our game.
For best performance you should obviously download it but most of it should work fine in WebGL.
Leave a comment about things you like and/or dislike.
Looking forward to play y'all games as well :D.
